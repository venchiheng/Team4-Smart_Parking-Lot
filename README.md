A microcontroller-based project using ESP32 to automate parking management. It uses IR sensors to detect vehicles, a servo motor to control the entry/exit gate, and RYG LEDs to indicate parking status (Available, Full, In-use). The system updates the vehicle count in real time, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
