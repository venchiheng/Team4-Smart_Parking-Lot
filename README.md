# ðŸš— Smart Parking Gate System using ESP32

This project implements an intelligent parking gate system using the ESP32 microcontroller. It automates vehicle entry and exit, monitors parking availability, and uploads data to the cloud via ThingSpeak.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Detects vehicle entry and exit using IR sensors
- Controls servo motor to open and close the gate
- Tracks real-time vehicle count and daily entries
- Updates ThingSpeak cloud dashboard
- Displays status with LED indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Available
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Full
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Gate opening/closing

# Team4-Smart_Parking-Lot
A microcontroller-based project using ESP32 to automate parking management. It uses IR sensors to detect vehicles, a servo motor to control the entry/exit gate, and RYG LEDs to indicate parking status (Available, Full, In-use). The system updates the vehicle count in real time, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
